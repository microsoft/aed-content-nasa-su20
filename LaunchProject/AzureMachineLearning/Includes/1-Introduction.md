# Introduction

Launching a rocket is a very expensive affair. Hundreds of people must check every aspect of the rocket and launch facility, move the rocket into position, and fuel it. So space agencies like the NASA have to delay a rocket launch at the last minute due to weather, it's a costly surprise. That's why space agencies (and now private companies) need to use tools like machine learning to try and spot potential delays before they go to the expense (and hazard) of preparing a rocket to launch.

Through this module, you will have an opportunity to explore different ways of performing machine learning. You'll start by using Azure Machine Learning as a highly automated AI service you can integrate with directly from Visual Studio Code. You will then go on to contrast that experience with performing machine learning locally using Python tools. Along the way, you will cleanse and prepare your data to better understand why this is such an important part of data science regardless of the tools you use to perform machine learning.

***Placeholder*** This module is part of a multi-modal approach to learning, which means that you can also follow along with a video tutorial on the [Learn with Dr G Learn TV video series](https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/SpaceJam).

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will begin to discover: 

- Python, Pandas, and Visual Studio Code
- The benefits of using cloud-based data-science services such as Azure Machine Learning
- Data cleansing and manipulation that requires critical analysis
- Using maching learning to classify data 
- Preparing data with specific machine-learning algorithms in mind

## Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code, with the Python Extension](https://aka.ms/LearnOnVSCode)
- A local Python environment set up, as seen in [Discover the role of Python in space exploration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/introduction-python-space-exploration-nasa/)

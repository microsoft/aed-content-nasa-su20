# Data Preparation Part 2 - Intermediate Steps

Sometimes it is also important to remove rows from datasets as well. That can be a little trickier than removing columns, but pandas has some powerful tools to make this part of data preparation easier.

## Check for and remove rows with NaNs for recorded launches

With the removal of several of the columns, the DataFrame is trimmed down, but we still have a lot of columns in which the majority of the entries are `NaN`. However, one of those columns is `Launched?`, which tells us if a rocket launch at the Kennedy Space Center actually went ahead, so we cannot just drop these columns. Instead, you will have to drop just to those rows that have `NaN` values in the `Launched?` column.

Drop these rows by using a mask. A mask is just a Boolean flag to applied to entries in a pandas Series or DataFrame based on some condition. For example, this code snippet creates a mask that reads `True` for values in the `Launched?` column that are not `NaN`:

```python
mask = data_df['Launched?'].notna()
mask
```

```output
0      False
1      False
2       True
3      False
4      False
       ...  
294    False
295    False
296     True
297    False
298    False
Name: Launched?, Length: 299, dtype: bool
```

We can apply it to the DataFrame using its `.loc` attribute. By default, `.iloc` returns DataFrame rows based on labels, such as row names or a mask. It has no `inplace` attribute, so we apply the mask to the DataFrame using `.loc` this way:

```python
launch_df = data_df.loc[mask]
launch_df.tail()
```

**output**

| | Name | Date | Time (East Coast) | Location | Crewed or Uncrewed | Launched? | High Temp | Low Temp | Ave Temp | Temp at Launch Time | ... | Hist Ave Temp | Percipitation at Launch Time | Hist Ave Percipitation | Wind Direction | Max Wind Speed | Visibility | Wind Speed at Launch Time | Sea Level Pressure | Day Length | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 276 | Gemini 7 | 4-Dec-65 | 20:03 | Cape Canaveral | Crewed | Y | 77 | 67 | 71.52 | 71.0 | ... | 65.0 | 0.00 | 0.08 | E | 15 | 10 | 12.0 | 30.19 | 10:27 | Cloudy |
| 281 | Gemini 8 | 16-Mar-66 | 17:41 | Cape Canaveral | Crewed | Y | 85 | 0 | 64.81 | 80.0 | ... | 66.0 | 0.00 | 0.11 | S | 16 | 15 | 4.0 | 29.95 | 12:00 | Cloudy |
| 286 | Gemini 9A | 3-Jun-66 | 14:39 | Cape Canaveral | Crewed | Y | 87 | 0 | 74.40 | 83.0 | ... | 79.0 | 0.00 | 0.19 | E | 15 | 15 | 6.0 | 29.96 | 13:49 | Cloudy |
| 291 | Space X Dragon | 27-May-20 | 16:33 | Cape Canaveral | Crewed | N | 86 | 70 | 75.02 | 74.0 | ... | 79.0 | 0.28 | 0.15 | S | 32 | 10 | 25.0 | 29.98 | 13:44 | Heavy T-Storm |
| 296 | Space X Dragon | 30-May-20 | 20:22 | Cape Canaveral | Crewed | Y | 87 | 75 | 79.69 | 80.0 | ... | 79.0 | 0.00 | 0.16 | SE | 16 | 10 | 7.0 | 30.03 | 13:47 | Fair |
5 rows Ã— 22 columns

We now have a DataFrame with just valid entries in the `Launched?` column. You can double-check this by using the DataFrame's `isna()` and `sum()` methods again.

```python
launch_df.isna().sum()
```

```output
Name                            0
Date                            0
Time (East Coast)               1
Location                        0
Crewed or Uncrewed              0
Launched?                       0
High Temp                       0
Low Temp                        0
Ave Temp                        0
Temp at Launch Time             0
Hist High Temp                  0
Hist Low Temp                   0
Hist Ave Temp                   0
Percipitation at Launch Time    0
Hist Ave Percipitation          0
Wind Direction                  0
Max Wind Speed                  0
Visibility                      0
Wind Speed at Launch Time       0
Sea Level Pressure              0
Day Length                      0
Condition                       0
dtype: int64
```

We still have a lingering `NaN` value in the `Time (East Coast)` column, but you can leave that be for now.

## Create DataFrame for module and rename columns for concision

The DataFrame is much more streamlined now. However, we likely don't need all of these features for our machine learning. For example, use the `value_counts()` method on the `Location` column to see how many of what values are in that column.

```python
launch_df['Location'].value_counts()
```

```output
Cape Canaveral    51
Kennedy            8
Name: Location, dtype: int64
```

Given that Cape Canaveral is simply the old name for the Kennedy Space Center, this column tells us nothing and thus can't provide any value in a machine-learning model. We should remove it, or at least not retain it.

There are other features in our dataset that are of questionable value to our models, such as historic average precipitation. Given the number of these, it will be easier to select those features most useful to us (name, data, time, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, day length, condition) and create a new DataFrame.

```python
df = launch_df[['Name', 
                'Date', 
                'Time (East Coast)', 
                'Launched?', 
                'Temp at Launch Time', 
                'Percipitation at Launch Time', 
                'Wind Speed at Launch Time', 
                'Visibility', 
                'Day Length', 
                'Condition']]
df.head()
```

**output**

| | Name | Date | Time (East Coast) | Launched? | Temp at Launch Time | Percipitation at Launch Time | Wind Speed at Launch Time | Visibility | Day Length | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | Pioneer 3 | 6-Dec-58 | 1:45 | Y | 62.00 | 0.00 | 11.00 | 10 | 10:25 | Cloudy |
| 7 | Pioneer 4 | 3-Mar-59 | 13:10 | Y | 78.00 | 0.00 | 12.00 | 7 | 11:38 | Cloudy |
| 12 | Ranger 1 | 23-Aug-61 | 11:04 | Y | 90.00 | 0.00 | 9.00 | 10 | 12:56 | Partly Cloudy |
| 17 | Ranger 2 | 18-Nov-61 | 9:09 | Y | 54.00 | 0.00 | 6.00 | 15 | 10:41 | Fair |
| 22 | Ranger 3 | 26-Jan-62 | 21:30 | Y | 53.00 | 0.00 | 17.00 | 10 | 10:45 | Fair |

We retained the names of the missions that launched as a convenient way to identify them. Given that they are unique, we can use them as the index for this new DataFrame in place of the default integer index assigned by pandas (which is in tatters after we deleted so many rows anyway). We do this with the `set_index()` methode, in which we supply the name of the column to use as the new index. You should also set the `inplace` parameter to `True`.

```python
df.set_index('Name', inplace=True)
df.head()
```

**output**

| <br>Name | Date | Time (East Coast) | Launched? | Temp at Launch Time  Percipitation at Launch Time | Wind Speed at Launch Time | Visibility | Day Length | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pioneer 3 | 6-Dec-58 | 1:45 | Y | 62.00 | 0.00 | 11.00 | 10 | 10:25 | Cloudy |
| Pioneer 4 | 3-Mar-59 | 13:10 | Y | 78.00 | 0.00 | 12.00 | 7 | 11:38 | Cloudy |
| Ranger 1 | 23-Aug-61 | 11:04 | Y | 90.00 | 0.00 | 9.00 | 10 | 12:56 | Partly Cloudy |
| Ranger 2 | 18-Nov-61 | 9:09 | Y | 54.00 | 0.00 | 6.00 | 15 | 10:41 | Fair |
| Ranger 3 | 26-Jan-62 | 21:30 | Y | 53.00 | 0.00 | 17.00 | 10 | 10:45 | Fair |

Many of our column names are too long to conveniently work with. We can rename them using the DataFrame `rename()` method (again, using the `inplace=True` parameter).

```python
df.rename(columns={'Time (East Coast)': 'Time', 
                   'Launched?': 'Launched', 
                   'Temp at Launch Time': 'Temp',
                   'Percipitation at Launch Time': 'Percipitation', 
                   'Wind Speed at Launch Time': 'Wind Speed'},
          inplace=True)
df.head()
```

**output**

| <br>Name | Date | Time | Launched | Temp | Percipitation | Wind Speed | Visibility | Day Length | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|	
| Pioneer 3 | 6-Dec-58 | 1:45 | Y | 62.00 | 0.00 | 11.00 | 10 | 10:25 | Cloudy |
| Pioneer 4 | 3-Mar-59 | 13:10 | Y | 78.00 | 0.00 | 12.00 | 7 | 11:38 | Cloudy |
| Ranger 1 | 23-Aug-61 | 11:04 | Y | 90.00 | 0.00 | 9.00 | 10 | 12:56 | Partly Cloudy |
| Ranger 2 | 18-Nov-61 | 9:09 | Y | 54.00 | 0.00 | 6.00 | 15 | 10:41 | Fair |
| Ranger 3 | 26-Jan-62 | 21:30 | Y | 53.00 | 0.00 | 17.00 | 10 | 10:45 | Fair |

Take a quick check for any lingering `NaN` values in the DataFrame:

```python
df.isna().sum()
```

```output
Date             0
Time             1
Launched         0
Temp             0
Percipitation    0
Wind Speed       0
Visibility       0
Day Length       0
Condition        0
dtype: int64
```

We still have one last `NaN` in the `Time` column. Given that we don't have a subject-matter expert to consult on how important time of day might be to our model, we shouldn't drop the column. We also don't know how we might go about imputing a value to fill in that last `NaN`, so the best course is to remove the row with that missing value. 

Use the `dropna()` method to remove the row by setting the `how` parameter to `'any'`. You don't have to specify 'rows' or 'columns' to the method as removing rows is the default setting for the method.

```python
df.dropna(inplace=True, how='any')
df.isna().sum()
```

```output
Date             0
Time             0
Launched         0
Temp             0
Percipitation    0
Wind Speed       0
Visibility       0
Day Length       0
Condition        0
dtype: int64
```

Because you will be uploading this data to Azure (and as a general best practice to save your data after so much work!), export the DataFrame to a CSV file.

```python
df.to_csv('prepped_launch_data_raw.csv')
```
